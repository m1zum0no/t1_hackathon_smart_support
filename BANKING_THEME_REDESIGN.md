# Banking Theme Redesign - Summary

## Overview
Transformed the Vue/Vuetify frontend from a casual chat interface to a professional, banking-appropriate design with reserved colors and improved typography suitable for a tech-support knowledge base retrieval service.

The new design uses a minimal, professional color scheme:

- **Section Card Wrapper (`#f4f4f9`)**: Secondary backgrounds
- **Text (`#212121`)**: Primary text color
- **Greyed Out Text (`#516077`)**: Secondary text and icons

Combine a conversation dataset (e.g., DailyDialog) with a pure knowledge base like MakTek/Customer_support_faqs_dataset (200 FAQs/answers) to create hybrid test sets.

# Retrieval Metrics

## Context Precision: 
Measures if retrieved chunks rank relevant info highly (e.g., top-k docs match ground truth). Formula: Average precision @k. Aim for >0.8.
## Context Recall: 
Fraction of ground-truth relevant docs retrieved. Formula: TP / (TP + FN). High recall ensures no missed instructions.
## Context Relevance: 
Semantic similarity (e.g., cosine via embeddings) between query and retrieved chunks. Use to filter noisy retrievals.

# Generation Metrics

## Faithfulness: 
Checks if generated recommendations are grounded in retrieved contexts (no hallucinations). RAGAS computes this via LLM-judged entailment; score 0-1.
## Answer Relevance: 
How well the output matches the query intent. Computed as embedding similarity between query and answer.
## Answer Similarity: 
Compares generated answer to ground-truth (from dataset). Use ROUGE (n-gram overlap) or BERTScore (semantic match); target ROUGE-1 >0.5.

# Overall/End-to-End Metrics

## RAGAS Score: 
Composite from faithfulness, relevance, etc. (via ragas.evaluate()). Provides a holistic 0-1 score.
## BLEU/ROUGE: 
For lexical similarity in conversations; useful for multi-turn testing.
## Human-like Metrics: 
Perplexity (for fluency) or LLM-as-judge (e.g., GPT-4 scoring coherence on 1-5 scale).
## Custom for Support: 
Resolution Rate (does it suggest correct steps?); Latency (real-time <2s); Escalation Accuracy (when to hand off to operator).

Test on holdout data from your datasets: Run queries, retrieve from vector DB, generate via Scibox, then score. Tools like RAGAS integrate with LangChain for easy setup. If metrics are low, iterate on chunking or prompts.
